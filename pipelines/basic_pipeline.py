    """
    This function represents a data forecasting pipeline that predicts the relative humidity of a given place one month into the future.

    The pipeline follows these steps:
    1. Ingest the data.
    2. Preprocess and split the data into training and test sets.
    3. Train a MLP model on the training data.
    4. Evaluate the model on the test data using RMSE, RÂ², and MAE.

    # Step 3: Train the model using the training data
